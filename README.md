This is a simple app to help discover new recipes which can be made with ingredients you already have. Enter a few ingredients into the entry fields, hit 'Get Recipes', and you will see the listbox populate with recipes.

If you don't see any recipes:
 - You may have entered a combination of ingredients that don't appear within the database of over 20,000 recipes. Or you may have a 	      misspelling. "Pencils, love, table" will yield no results as will "egs, bacn, tost." 
 - You may have entered some ingredients that aren't being found together. I bet "sardines, chocolate, soy, milk" will yield no results.
 
When the recipes populate:
 Click the top line of the recipe and drag to the bottom. The entire recipe will be selected. Then click the 'Open Recipe' button
 
This is still a work in progress.
