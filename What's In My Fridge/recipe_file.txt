***********************

1⁄2 cup  butter
2 (1  ounce)  unsweetened chocolate squares (no substitutions)
2  eggs
1  cup  sugar
1⁄2 cup  sifted flour
1⁄4 teaspoon  baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon  salt
1  cup chopped walnuts (or other nuts of choice) (optional)
1  teaspoon  vanilla extract

***********************
Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  Butter an 8 x8 x 2" pan.Melt butter and chocolate together over a double-boiler.In a medium bowl, beat eggs well.  Add sugar gradually and beat thoroughly until incorporated.  Add chocolate mixture and beat well.In a separate bowl, mix sifted flour, baking powder and salt.  Add nuts (if using).  Stir into chocolate mixture and add vanilla.  Mix well.Place in buttered pan and bake for about 25 minutes.  Cut into squares while still warm.  Makes 9 squares.NOTE:  If you want to make it in a 9 x 13" pan, triple the recipe.  This I normally do when making it for parties or to feed 3 hungry nephews.Note that the chocolate squares noted in ingredients above are 1 ounce for each square, therefore the total is 2 ounces.
