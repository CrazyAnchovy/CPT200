recipe_db.db has 20089 records at the time of writing 9/21/2018. Each record has three columns: name, ingredients and directions. Each cell is a string object.

Searching the database will consist of finding an ingredient included in an ingredient column's string. For instance, when prompted to enter an ingredient, and a user enters 'chicken' the software will present each recipe where the word 'chicken' is included in the ingredients.

Into the GUI, one will enter one or more ingredients they have, and will be presented with several recipes.
